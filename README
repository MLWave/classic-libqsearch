This software is released under the BSD license.

Please see the website for more info!  Good luck with your experiments! :)

Quick Install
------------------

CompLearn requires the Gnu Scientific Libary, GSL, to be installed before
attempting to build.  You may use the command
gsl-config --libs
to check this if you like; if it prints something with -L and -l, it means
GSL is installed.  If you would rather let the complearn system check, you
will be notified when you attempt to configure as the first step in the
following build and install sequence.

./configure
make
make install

If you do not have root access, you may need to do something like this:

./configure --prefix=$HOME/complearn
make
make install

In order to build the graphical demo, clfun, or the Google SOAP compressor
you must have certain packages installed as documented on the website.
